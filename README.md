# Welcome to WeatherNow (Old)!
### There is a new, updated version in the works. It will be located at https://weathernow.web.app/ when finished.
* This program was built using the OpenWeatherMap API.
* The OpenWeatherMap API is able to be called up to 60 times per minute, so please do not spam requests.
* The program will display the weather/temperature, how cloudy it is, the wind speed and direction, and humidity level at the location you enter.
* NOTE: Specific cities cannot be chosen. For example, when "Sicily" is typed in, a city in the US named Sicily comes up, not the one in Italy.
* NOTE: Due to a bug in the API (as noted by those at the OpenWeather team), all zip code inputs will default to Mexico.

Thank you for using WeatherNow!

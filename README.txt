Welcome to WeatherNow!
Please make sure that you keep all files of this program in the same folder (index.html, style.css, app.js, and the .jpg files) for the program to function.
To access the program, open index.html with your browser of choice.
This program was built using the OpenWeatherMap API.
The OpenWeatherMap API is able to be called up to 60 times per minute, so please do not spam requests.
The program will display the weather/temperature, how cloudy it is, the wind speed and direction, and humidity level at the location you enter.
NOTE: Specific cities cannot be chosen. For example, when "Sicily" is typed in, a city in the US named Sicily comes up, not the one in Italy.
NOTE: Due to a bug in the API (as noted by those at the OpenWeather team), all zip code inputs will default to Mexico.
Thank you for using WeatherNow!
